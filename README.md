# Shared Household Bill Splitter

## What it does

Housemates often pay shared expenses at different times, then have to remember who owes what. This app keeps a simple household ledger: create a home, add its members, record shared bills, and track each person's unpaid share.

Bills are divided evenly among the members who belong to the home when the bill is created. Shares use whole cents, so any remainder is assigned one cent at a time in member creation order. For example, ₹1,000 shared by three members becomes ₹334, ₹333, and ₹333. The balances view totals each member's unpaid shares across bills.

The **Mark paid** action records that a share has been settled and updates the outstanding balance. It does not process or transfer money. This take-home project has no authentication; anyone with a home's ID can open and update that household, so it is a prototype rather than a secure production ledger.

## How to use it

1. Create a household and add its members.
2. Record a bill with its title and total amount.
3. Review the split, then mark each share paid when the housemate settles it.
4. Return to the same household using its home ID, which is also saved in the current browser.

## Assignment brief

This repository is the SDE intern take-home implementation. The assignment emphasizes correct data handling, defensive input validation, payment idempotency, and understandable TypeScript.

The assignment is small on purpose. We want correct, safe, and clear code. We do not want many features.

## What we look at

- **Your code passes the tests.** The tests decide, not opinion. You get the visible tests. We also run extra tests that you do not see.
- **Your code is safe when things go wrong.** Wrong input, repeated requests, and two requests at the same time must not break your data.
- **Your code is typed.** Use TypeScript. Do not use `any`.
- **You understand your code.** You record a short video and explain it.

Take your time. A careful, correct solution is better than a fast one. We expect 2 to 3 days of real work.

## The task

The assignment has two parts. Do Part 1 first. Part 2 builds on it.

**Database.** Write the schema as SQL migration files in `api/migrations/`. For example `0001_init.sql`. The tests apply every file in this folder. Your schema must have **at least 3 named constraints** that protect the data. For example a foreign key, a `CHECK`, or a `UNIQUE` key. Be ready to explain what each constraint stops.

**Errors.** Every error response is JSON: `{ "error": "message" }`.

## Part 1: Homes and members

Create a home and add members to it. The order in which members are added matters in Part 2.

#### `POST /api/homes`

- Request: `{ "name": string }`
- Success: `201` `{ id, name }`

#### `POST /api/homes/:homeId/members`

- Request: `{ "name": string }`
- Success: `201` `{ id, homeId, name }`
- Errors: `404` home not found

Visible tests: `api/test/homes.test.ts`.

## Part 2: Bill splitting

Add a bill to a home, split it between the members, and let each member pay their share.

All amounts are whole **cents** (integers). `100` cents is 1 dollar. Never use decimals for money.

#### `POST /api/homes/:homeId/bills`

- Request: `{ "title": string, "totalCents": number }`
- Success: `201` `{ id, homeId, title, totalCents, shares: [{ id, memberId, amountCents, paidAt: null }] }`
- Errors: `404` home not found. `422` total is not a positive whole number, or the home has no members.

#### `POST /api/bills/:billId/shares/:shareId/pay`

- Request: header `Idempotency-Key`
- Success: `200` `{ id, memberId, amountCents, paidAt }`
- Errors: `400` key missing. `404` bill or share not found. `409` share already paid with a different key.

#### `GET /api/homes/:homeId/balances`

- Success: `200` `{ balances: [{ memberId, name, outstandingCents }] }`
- Errors: `404` home not found

**Rules**

- **Split.** A bill is split between all members of the home. The shares always add up to `totalCents`. If the amount does not divide evenly, the extra cents go to the members one by one, in the order the members were added to the home. Example: 1000 cents between 3 members gives `334`, `333`, `333`.
- **Pay.** Paying marks one share as paid and sets `paidAt`. If the same `Idempotency-Key` is sent again for the same share, answer `200` with the same result. Do not pay twice. If two requests pay the same share at the same time, only one may succeed.
- **Balances.** `outstandingCents` is the sum of the member's unpaid shares, across all bills of the home. List the members in the order they were added.

Visible tests: `api/test/bills.test.ts` and `api/test/payments.test.ts`.

#### Web page

Build one page that:

- shows the bills of a home and the shares of each bill,
- lets a member pay a share,
- shows clear **loading**, **empty**, and **error** states,
- keeps the share unpaid and shows an error if the payment fails.

The page must not crash when the API answers with an error or is slow.

## Cases you must handle

You must handle these cases and talk about them in your video:

1. A home with no members.
2. An amount that is zero, negative, or not a whole number.
3. An amount that does not divide evenly.
4. The same payment request sent twice.
5. Two members paying the same share at the same time.
6. A bill or share that does not exist.
7. The API answers with a 500 error or is slow. The web page must not crash.

## Run it

This is a pnpm workspace. Install once at the root.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # api on :8787 and web on :5173
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The starter page shows a title. `/api/health` returns `{ "status": "ok" }`.

```bash
pnpm test         # run the visible tests in api/test
pnpm check        # Biome: format and lint. Must pass.
pnpm check:fix    # fix what Biome can fix
pnpm typecheck    # tsc on both packages. Must pass.
pnpm build        # production build of the web app
```

`pnpm dev` applies your migrations to a local database before it starts the API.

If pnpm says some build scripts were ignored, run `pnpm approve-builds` and allow `esbuild` and `workerd`.

When you change `api/wrangler.jsonc`, refresh the `Env` types:

```bash
pnpm --filter bill-splitter-api cf-typegen
```

## Rules for the tests

- The visible tests are in `api/test`. They start with a failing result. Your job is to make them pass.
- Do **not** change the visible tests or `api/test/helpers.ts`. We compare them with the original.
- We run extra tests after you submit. They test the cases in "Cases you must handle" more closely.

## AI policy

You can use AI tools. Tell us which ones and where in your answers on the form.
You must understand every line you submit. We check this with your video and in a live call. "The AI wrote it" is not an answer.

## How to submit

1. Click **Use this template**, then **Create a new repository**. Make the repository **public**.
2. Build your solution in your new repository. Small, clear commits are welcome.
3. Update this README with a short section called **Decisions**. Write 3 decisions you made and why.
4. Record a video of **3 minutes or less** (Loom or unlisted YouTube). Show the architecture, the data flow, and one trade-off you made. Make sure anyone with the link can view it.
5. Paste the repository link and the video link in the application form.

## Decisions

1. **Store money as integer cents.** Bill totals and shares are validated as positive whole cents, and the remainder goes to the earliest members. This keeps the share sum exact without floating-point money math.
2. **Make payment a conditional database update.** A share is paid only when its `paid_at` field is still empty. The idempotency key is stored with the payment, so a retry returns the original result while a competing key gets a conflict.
3. **Keep the page on the API path.** The household, bill and balance views load from API responses. A payment stays visually unpaid until the server confirms it; request errors remain visible so the user can retry.

We will run `pnpm install && pnpm check && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test` on your repository.
